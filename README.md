# Reassemble (WIP)

User-friendly gear comparison tool for Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers. Ditch the spreadsheet and simulate DPS 
with your exact kill time, party composition, and playstyle by leveraging FFLogs and Etro.


## Usage

An extremely WIP build is available for testing at http://142.93.57.143/. To use it, simply enter an FFLogs fight and get started. 

Currently, only the physical ranged jobs are supported (Bard, Dancer, Machinist).

## Contributing

1. Grab the repo with `git clone`
1. Install deps with `yarn install`
1. Rename `.env_dev` to `.env` and add your FFLogs API key
1. Run `yarn serve` to launch the dev server at `localhost:7000`
