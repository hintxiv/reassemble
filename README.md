# Reassemble (WIP)

User-friendly gear comparison tool for Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers. Ditch the spreadsheet and simulate DPS 
with your exact kill time, party composition, and playstyle by leveraging FFLogs and Etro.


## Usage

~~An extremely WIP build is available for testing at http://142.93.57.143/~~. The beta has been taken down, but the project is still being worked on and can be configured locally. To use it, simply enter an FFLogs fight and get started. 

## Job Status

✔️ Bard [6.08]
